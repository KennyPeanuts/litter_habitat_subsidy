## Purpose

The experiment is designed to test the hypothesis that leaf litter in small man-made ponds serves as a habitat subsidy but not a trophic subsidy.

This experiment is a modification of the experiment that was conducted in 2016 but had technical difficulties and therefore yielded no results.  In the 2016 experiment, we attempted to create leaf-free treatments but too much of the fine sediment passes through the 1 mm mesh we were using and so the baskets did not accurately represent the pond substrate.

In this experiment, we are not attempting a leaf free treatment but are going to use "leaf" cut-outs from a brown paper bag to provide an inedible but structurally similar material

### Research Question

To what degree are pond macroinvertebrates using leaf litter in the pond as a trophic subsidy and a habitat subsidy?

### Hypothesis

If leaves are an important trophic subsidy for pond macroinvertebrate taxa then there will be greater colonization of conditioned leaves than unconditioned leaves, and colonization of actual leaves will be greater than structurally similar but inedible material.

## Experimental Design

### Treatment 

We are manipulating leaf palatability using the following treatment levels:

* **Unpalatable** - leaf shapes cut from brown paper bags

* **Low Palatability** - Fresh leaf litter collected from the adjacent forest floor that has not been conditioned in the pond

* **High Palalatbility** - Leaf litter collected from the littoral zone of the pond that has been conditioned in the pond

### Experimental Unit

The different leaf litter sources will be incubated in 9 mm^2 mesh litter bags

### Replication

Each treatment level will be replicated 4 times for a total of 12 bags

### Response Variables

* Change in leaf AFDM

* Abundance and identity of macroinvertebrates associated with the leaf packs

* Leaf C:N 
 
## Set-up Protocol

1. Collect leaf litter from the forest floor adjacent to Lancer Park Pond

2. Collect leaf litter from the littoral zone of LPP

3. Sample intact and appropriately conditioned leaf litter from each source for each of the litter bags 

4. Identify the appropriate leaf mass for a litter bag (guessing about 10 g)

5. Cut a "leaves" from the paper bags to approximately match the size and mass of the leaves in the samples 

6. Portion the leaves into the litter bags and create 3 litter bags at each treatment level for the T-0 sample for initial mass and C/N

  * we need a total of 7 litter bags at each treatment level 

7. Place litter bags randomly into the littoral zone of the pond

8. Immediately remove 3 of the bags of each treatment level as a handling control

9. Incubate the remaining bags in the pond for 4 weeks

10. After removing the bags, carefully rinse the leaves over the 250 um sieve to remove all macroinvertebrates

11. Preserve all the material retained by the sieve in 70% EtOH

12. Collect 10, 1 cm leaf discs from the leaves in the sample and pool the discs into a pre-weighed crucible and dry for C/N

13. Dry the remaining leaf mass at 50 dC

14. Ash the leaf material at 550 dC to determine AFDM
